# Coding_Challenge-8

This coding challenge is all about **realizing the power that you have as a developer to validate business ideas**. The reason I became a programmer was because I wanted to build businesses without having to hire a developer. If I had an idea, I want to test out the market and see if my idea is worth pursuing. Being a developer allows you to really test out your ideas. Whether you want to be an entrepreneur, co-founder, or someone who can build websites fast, this challenge will help you realize the power that you now have to build anything you dream up. In addition, you are going to have another website to add to your portfolio! 


## Prizes!
This challenge is kindly sponsored by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/)! The top 3 entries of this challenge who will be selected by Creative Tim staff and myself will **each win the [Big Bundle](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/buy/bundle/big-bundle) worth $2,681 each**. By the way, you can read the founder's story and how he build this business from the ground up here - they did something similar to what we are doing in this challenge: https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/using-a-freemium-business-model-to-grow-revenue-to-17-000-mo-fcd1be4ff4

## What is the Challenge?
Build a startup landing page that actually works! Start off by reading this excellent article: https://medium.com/@timferriss/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas-fae4dab10842
Then, go through the **[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), Templates, And Building Your Startup Landing Page** in the Zero to Mastery course if you need a refresher. You will need to build a landing page with your business product being showcased, and an email signup form. This email form should be signed up to something like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/). which will allow you to collect user emails to see how many people are interested in your product. You will now have a way to test your idea and see if people like it! 
  > Remember: 
    The idea can be silly.
    You will be judged on the website, not on the product or how valid of an idea it is. 
  
Have fun with it:+1: .

## The Rules Are:

1. You HAVE TO use two things from Creative Tim
    - [Starter Project](https://github.com/timcreative/udemy-nuk) 
    - [NOW UI Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/now-ui-kit)
  
    - You will use those to start off the project but you can customaize or add to it whatever you like afterwards. Be creative. 

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team.
